# ToDoWebApp
Developed a feature-rich MERN stack web application where user can do Registration, Login, can view Public Task or Their Private Task, can Change their Profile and can Update Password with MySQL database integration, enabling users to modify Visibility of personal tasks with options for public or private visibility. Implemented secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and encrypted passwords with CryptoJS MD5. Integrated Nodemailer for email notifications upon successful user registration. Designed a responsive frontend with React, leveraging component-based architecture, React Router for navigation, and React Toast to interact with user. Built a modular web services layer for seamless API communication with the backend using Axios. Created an admin panel for managing user activities, including the ability to deactivate users, restricting their login access. Utilized Postman for API testing and ensured robust state management within React components.
